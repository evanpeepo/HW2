# HW2
HW2 for ZOO800. Evan Peepo, Samantha Summerfield, Maggie Phillips


Objective 1

For search terms "watershed + hydrology + nitrogen" (Maggie's search):
1) Nine papers used open-source software--either R and/or a variety of open-source models (SWAT, MODFLOW).
2) One paper (out of 10) placed data in a repository. This paper used Zenodo. They linked to it again on GitHub. Many papers used publicly available data, like from the USGS.
3) One paper (the same as above) placed their code in a repository. They used GitHub.

Samantha’s search:
Search terms were “DOM (dissolved organic matter) + FTICRMS”
1) Six out of ten of the articles used open source software (mostly R)
2) Four of the ten put their data on a public repository, which was already publicly available through ESS-DIVE, Earth Chem and Center for Open Science.
3) One of the ten put their code on a public repository (it was python not R) and two out of ten put a version of their code written in the SI

Evan's search: 'pinyon pine', 'xylem hydraulics', 'carbon starvation' 
1) 8/10 used open-source software (R).
2) 7/10 have data available on a public repository. Dryad, ESS-DIVE, Figshare, and Zonodo were used.
3) Available code was less common. Only 3/10 had code available. Figshare and Github were used. The code and data for Objective 2 were found on Github.  

Objective 2
1. Thompson et al. 2023. No carbon storage in growth-limited trees in a semi-arid woodland
3. Ran lines 1056-1224. Loaded packages tidyverse and ggplot2 (already installed). 
4. Figure 3C 
5. No changes were needed to run this (besides typing the variable name to show the plot). Required data was within the repository and paths were relative.
