Objective 1

For search terms "watershed + hydrology + nitrogen" (Maggie's search):
1) Nine papers used open-source software--either R and/or a variety of open-source models (SWAT, MODFLOW).
2) One paper (out of 10) placed data in a repository. This paper used Zenodo. They linked to it again on GitHub. Many papers used publicly available data, like from the USGS.
3) One paper (the same as above) placed their code in a repository. They used GitHub.




Objective 2
1. Thompson et al. 2023. No carbon storage in growth-limited trees in a semi-arid woodland
3. Ran lines 1056-1224. Loaded packages tidyverse and ggplot2
